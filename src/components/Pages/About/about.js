          I'm drawn to challenges that require creativity and constant
          progression. I believe my passion for progression comes from
          skateboarding - perpetual learning and the desire to be better than you
          were yesterday.

          After I began to study computer science in college, I realized that
          programming had a similar mentality and pleasure. I want to take my
          passion for learning and progression and apply my skills as a software
          developer. I'm not sure where I would like to specialize which is why im
          looking to get my foot in the door and start my career.
